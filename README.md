# Manifesto
We are the Long Neck Jokers
We laugh at the world's folly
We see beyond the surface
We stretch our necks to reach the sky

We are not here to conform
We are here to create
We make art out of chaos
We shape our own fate

We are not alone
We are a community
We share our vision and passion
We support each other's journey

We are not afraid
We are brave and bold
We challenge the status quo
We break the mold

We are not bound by reality
We are free to explore
We dream of a metaverse
Where we own what we adore

Join us if you dare
Join us if you care
Join us if you share our flair

KayanJokers unite!
KayanJokers ignite!
KayanJokers delight!
